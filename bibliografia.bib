abstract = {Hierarchically structured data are commonly represented as trees and have given rise
to popular data formats like XML or JSON. An interesting query computes the difference
between two versions of a tree, expressed as the minimum set of node edits (deletion,
insertion, label rename) that transform one tree into another, commonly known as the
tree edit distance. Unfortunately, the fastest tree edit distance algorithms run in
cubic time and quadratic space and are therefore not feasible for large inputs. In
this paper, we leverage the fact that the difference between two versions of a tree
is typically much smaller than the overall tree size. We propose a new tree edit distance
algorithm that is linear in the tree size for similar trees. Our algorithm is based
on the new concept of top node pairs and avoids redundant distance computations, the
main issue with previous solutions for tree diffs. We empirically evaluate the runtime
of our algorithm on large synthetic and real-world trees; our algorithm clearly outperforms
the state of the art, often by orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {We introduce a system called Penrose for creating mathematical diagrams. Its basic
functionality is to translate abstract statements written in familiar math-like notation
into one or more possible visual representations. Rather than rely on a fixed library
of visualization tools, the visual representation is user-defined in a constraint-based
specification language; diagrams are then generated automatically via constrained
numerical optimization. The system is user-extensible to many domains of mathematics,
and is fast enough for iterative design exploration. In contrast to tools that specify
diagrams via direct manipulation or low-level graphics programming, Penrose enables
rapid creation and exploration of diagrams that faithfully preserve the underlying
mathematical meaning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the system
by showing how it can be used to illustrate a diverse set of concepts from mathematics
and computer graphics.},
